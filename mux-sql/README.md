# Product Catelog
A sample url shortener app to test Keploy integration capabilities

## Installation Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go.git && cd samples-go/mux-sql
go mod download
```

## Installation Keploy
Install keploy via one-click:-

```sh
curl --silent -O -L https://keploy.io/install.sh && source install.sh
```

### Start Postgres Instance 

Using the docker-compose file we will start our postgres instance:-

```bash
# Start Postgres
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

### Update the Host

> **Since we have setup our sample-app natively set the host to `localhost` on line 10.**

### Capture the Testcases

Now, we will create the binary of our application:-

```zsh
go build -cover
```

Once we have our binary file ready,this command will start the recording of API calls using ebpf:-

```shell
sudo -E keploy record -c "./test-app-product-catelog"
```

Make API Calls using Hoppscotch, Postman or cURL command. Keploy with capture those calls to generate the test-suites containing testcases and data mocks.

#### Generate testcases

To genereate testcases we just need to make some API calls. You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), or simply `curl`

### 1. Generate shortned url

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8010/product \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "name":"Bubbles", 
    "price": 123
}'
```
this will return the response. 
```
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Bubbles",
    "price": 123
}
```

### 2. Fetch the Products
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8010/products
```

we will get output:

```json
[{"id":1,"name":"Bubbles","price":123},{"id":2,"name":"Bubbles","price":123}]
```

### 3. Fetch a single product

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8010/product/1

we will get output:-
```json
{"id":1,"name":"Bubbles","price":123}
```

Now, since these API calls were captured as editable testcases and written to ``keploy/tests folder``. The keploy directory would also have `mocks` files that contains all the outputs of postgres operations. 

![Testcase](./img/testcase.png?raw=true)

Now let's run the test mode (in the mux-sql directory, not the Keploy directory).

```shell
sudo -E keploy test -c "./test-app-product-catelog" --delay 10 --goCoverage
```

Once done, you can see the Test Runs on the Keploy server, like this:

![Testrun](./img/testrun.png?raw=true)

So no need to setup fake database/apis like Postgres or write mocks for them. Keploy automatically mocks them and, **The application thinks it's talking to Postgres ðŸ˜„**

With the three API calls that we made, we got around `55.6%` of coverage
